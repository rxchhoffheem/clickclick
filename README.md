# Heem's Clicking Game (clickclick)

A lightweight browser clicker game — fast to load, easy to play, and designed for experimentation.

Features
- Click to earn money + shop with many upgrades
- Auto CPS (per-second income), badges, rebirth/prestige
- Persistent saves (localStorage) with save versioning
- Keyboard shortcuts: Space = click, S = shop, B = badges, R = rebirth
- Mobile-friendly layout and optional sound/haptics

Goals for the next release
- Modular architecture (easier to contribute)
- Mobile polish: vibration, improved tap feedback
- Offline earnings: accrue CPS while away
- Accessibility improvements and better keyboard focus
- CI + deploy to GitHub Pages

Play demo
- You can open index.html locally or deploy to GitHub Pages.

Contributing
- Open an issue describing your idea or bug.
- For code: fork → branch → PR. I recommend small focused PRs:
  - `feat/ui` for design polish
  - `refactor/modules` for splitting script.js
  - `ci` for GH Actions and tests

- MIT (or choose your preferred license)
